## Why Restore Old Photos?

Family photos are irreplaceable treasures. Over time, they fade, develop scratches, and lose their original beauty. Traditional restoration by a professional can cost $50–$200 per photo and take days or weeks.

With AI-powered restoration, you can bring those memories back to life in seconds — for free.

## How AI Photo Restoration Works

Modern AI models like Google Gemini can analyze damaged photos and intelligently reconstruct missing details:

1. **Upload your photo** — Simply drag and drop your old photo onto our platform.
2. **AI analyzes the damage** — The model detects fading, scratches, blur, water damage, and more.
3. **Instant restoration** — In seconds, you get a restored version with enhanced clarity, color, and detail.

## Tips for Best Results

- **Use the highest resolution scan possible.** The more detail the AI has to work with, the better the output.
- **Choose the right tool.** We offer 12 specialized tools — pick the one that matches your photo's main issue.
- **Try multiple tools.** For heavily damaged photos, you can run the result through a second tool for further improvement.

## Before & After

Our AI can handle a wide range of damage types:

- Faded colors → Vibrant, natural tones
- Scratches & creases → Clean, smooth surfaces
- Blur & noise → Sharp, clear details
- Black & white → Realistic colorization
