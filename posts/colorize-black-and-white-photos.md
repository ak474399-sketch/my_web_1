## The Magic of AI Colorization

Black and white photos capture a moment in time, but seeing those moments in color creates an entirely different emotional connection. AI colorization uses deep learning to predict and apply realistic colors based on the content of each image.

## How It Works

Our colorization AI:

1. **Identifies objects and materials** — It recognizes skin, fabric, vegetation, sky, wood, metal, and other materials.
2. **Applies contextual colors** — Based on the era, lighting conditions, and material types, it chooses historically plausible colors.
3. **Maintains consistency** — Skin tones, shadows, and highlights all stay consistent across the image.

## What Makes Good Colorization?

The best AI colorization results share these qualities:

- **Natural skin tones** — No orange or pink casting on faces
- **Consistent lighting** — Colors match the light direction and intensity
- **Material accuracy** — Wool looks like wool, silk looks like silk
- **Historical plausibility** — Colors match what was common for the era

## Tips for Best Results

- **Higher resolution = better colors.** Scan your photos at 300 DPI or higher.
- **Good contrast helps.** If your photo is very faded, try restoring it first with our [Faded Photo Repair](/restore/faded-photo-repair) tool, then colorize.
- **Portraits work best.** AI is especially good at colorizing faces and clothing.

## Try It Yourself
