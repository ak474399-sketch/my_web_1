## Common Types of Photo Damage

Old photographs can suffer from many forms of degradation. Understanding the type of damage helps you choose the right restoration approach.

### 1. Fading and Color Shift

**What it looks like:** Colors appear washed out, yellowish, or have an overall color cast.

**Why it happens:** UV light exposure and chemical reactions in the photo paper cause dyes to break down over decades.
